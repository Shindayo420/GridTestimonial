        <p class="card__quote">
            They were wonderful to work with. we communicated easily. they totally understood what I needed. And, worked with me if there was something I didn't explain clearly. They finished several days early and designed a beautiful site for me. I will use them again and again on anything that has to do with web design! They were very patient and great at answering questions. I look forward to working with them again. I am happy with how my site looks and everything works well. The site was fnished faster than our original timeline."
